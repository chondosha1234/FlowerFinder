        This application utilizes a trained neural network model to recognize photos of different flowers.
        At the moment there are currently 5 flower categories in the model.
        The plants are generally selected for their appearance in the North East United States, in order to be tested and applicable to the developer\'s life.
        As of now this is mainly a proof of concept project, but could potentially be expanded to include more flowers from all over the United States,
        or to include other plants such as trees.</string>

        Either there is actually no flower or there was a failure in the machine.
